# 4. Aggregating json data

# Here we will do group by and sum aggregation without using pandas or sql, 
# but plain python to practice the underlying mechanics behind the language.

# a) Read in the file paid.json inside of the data folder. Hint: use load() function from the json library.

# b) Now group each name and sum over the total payment. Hint: use defaultdict(int) from collections library

# c) Output the result into a new json file called payment_sum.json.
